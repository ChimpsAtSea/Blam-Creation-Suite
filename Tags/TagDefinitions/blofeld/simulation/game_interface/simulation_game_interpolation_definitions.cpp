In bandwidth-constrained multiplayer games (i.e. most games), we will receive only one or two updates per second for faraway objects.  Even near objects may frequently be dropped to <5 updates per second, especially crates, garbage bits, and similar less important elements of the simulation.  Between updates, each peer predicts the motion of each object.  These predictions are often wrong (by anything from an inch to dozens of feet).  The simulation interpolation system is responsible for correcting these mispredictions in as aesthetically pleasing a way as possible, without harming the integrity of the game.  The details of the technical implementation are beyond the scope of this explanation, but various configuration parameters are exposed here.  \n\nThe tooltips for each configuration parameter should be helpful.
