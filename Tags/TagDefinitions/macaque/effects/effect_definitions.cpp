Always supplied\n\nnormal\nVector pointing directly away from the surface you collided with.

Supplied for effects from collision.\n\nbackward\nThe \'incident\' vector i.e. the opposite of the direction the object is moving in. Supplied for effects from collision.\n\nreflection\nThe way the effect would reflect off the surface it hit. Supplied for effects from collision.\n\nroot\nThe object root (pivot). These can used for all effects which are associated with an object.\n\nimpact\nThe location of a havok impact.\n\nwater_surface\nPoint of the effect projected to the water surface above it.
